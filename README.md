# Karamoja-Food-Insecurity-Analysis

Karamoja is a region in Uganda that is notable for the severe nature of its food insecurity. This has been caused by low productivity levels brought about by intense droughts and pest disease outbreaks.

This analysis seeks to develop a food security monitoring tool to shed light on the entire state of the region for NGOs providing technical support and farm inputs to the area.

Through this, the study will look at the two staple crops in the region- Maize and Sorghum. The yields of the crops will be analyzed and compared.
